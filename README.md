# RTX-KG2 Gateway

Enabling RTX-KG2 data access through various means.

## Installation

Please use Python [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) to run and install related content.
The Poetry environment for this project includes dependencies which help run IDE environments, manage the data, and run workflows.

```bash
# after installing poetry, create the environment
poetry install
```

## Development

### Jupyter Lab

Please follow installation steps above and then use a relevant Jupyter environment to open and explore the notebooks under the `notebooks` directory.

```bash
# after creating poetry environment, run jupyter
poetry run jupyter lab
```

### Poe the Poet

We use [Poe the Poet](https://poethepoet.natn.io/index.html) to define and run tasks defined within `pyproject.toml` under the section `[tool.poe.tasks*]`.
This allows for the definition and use of a task workflow when implementing multiple procedures in sequence.

For example, use the following to run the `notebook_sample_data_generation` task:

```bash
# run data_prep task using poethepoet defined within `pyproject.toml`
poetry run poe notebook_sample_data_generation
```

Existing tasks:

- `notebook_sample_data_generation`: generates a sample parquet dataset and adds to a kuzu database.
- `notebook_full_data_generation`: generates full dataset and adds to a kuzu database.
- `notebook_full_data_generation_with_metanames`: generates full dataset with metanames specificity and adds to a kuzu database in similar fashion.

> âš  Suggested hardware resources:
> Kuzu data ingest may require memory and storage beyond that of common laptop constraint.
> A recent run `notebook_full_data_generation_with_metanames` involved the use of the following resources:
> - Storage: ~40 GB (JSON, Parquet, Kuzu, and compressed files)
> - Memory: ~32 GB (GCP VM [`e2-standard-16`](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#e2-standard) was used for this purpose).
> - CPU: 4 vCPU (see VM note above).
